# Transaction Fraud Detection (IEEE-CIS)

A tabular machine learning project for detecting fraudulent online transactions using transaction and identity features.
This repository is structured as a clean, reproducible portfolio project: clear data setup, notebook-based workflow, and safe handling of large files.

## Problem
Predict whether a transaction is fraudulent (`isFraud`) based on transaction-level signals and optional identity attributes.

## Dataset
This project uses the **IEEE-CIS Fraud Detection** dataset (Kaggle). The raw CSVs are large and are **not included** in this repository.

Place the following files under `data/raw/`:

- `train_transaction.csv`
- `test_transaction.csv`
- `train_identity.csv`
- `test_identity.csv`
- `sample_submission.csv` (optional)

> The folder `data/raw/` is ignored by Git by design (see `.gitignore`).

> Download the dataset from Kaggle:
- https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/ieee-fraud-detection/data


## Workflow
- **EDA**: missing values, feature distributions, target imbalance, basic sanity checks  
- **Preprocessing**: imputation, encoding, scaling (as needed), and train/validation split strategy  
- **Modeling**: baseline classifiers + boosted tree models (XGBoost / LightGBM / CatBoost)  
- **Imbalance handling**: oversampling techniques (`imblearn`) where appropriate  
- **Evaluation**: classification metrics (e.g., ROC-AUC) and model comparison  
- **Submission artifacts**: Kaggle submission CSVs are generated by the notebook during execution (not committed)

## Notebook
- `notebooks/fraud_detection.ipynb`

## Run locally (optional)
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
jupyter notebook
```
Then open:
- `notebooks/fraud_detection.ipynb`

## Notes
- Large datasets are excluded from version control.
- If you generate intermediate data or submission files, keep them under `data/processed/` or `outputs/` (both can be ignored).
